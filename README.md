# ðŸ§¬ Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses supervised machine learning to classify whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on various features. The goal is to build a reliable predictive model using Python.

##  Files

- `Breast Cancer Prediction.ipynb` â€” Main Jupyter Notebook with complete code
- `data.csv` (optional) â€” Dataset file if not loaded from sklearn

##  Objective

To predict breast cancer diagnosis (malignant or benign) using ML algorithms and evaluate model performance.

##  Libraries Used

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## âœ… Results

The machine learning model was trained to classify breast cancer tumors as **benign** or **malignant** using clinical data.

### ðŸ”¹ Model Performance

- **Accuracy:** 96.5%  
- The model performed well with both high precision and recall values.
